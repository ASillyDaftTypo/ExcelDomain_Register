ExcelDomain_Register
====================

Script for Excel spreadsheet to track list of domain status, cost estimations, location etc

Script for a multi-page Excel Spreadsheet to track domain status, estimated costs, location etc.

I complied this at my first job at a small web/software company who, over the years, had amassed over 900 sites.
These were located across various hosts for all of their facilities, different registrars etc. Some portions such as the web host, mail host, DNS and domain registration were not controlled by us, but combinations of each of these were.

Put simply, it was a mess. But hey, what better way for a new-start to impress than to catalogue disorganised legacy systems in a couple of days? Not bad for a guy who hasn't touched any VB in over 3 years... (Okay, okay, the internet is a beautiful thing - things like opening an invisible command shell and the show() function were snippets that I found online and adapted for use.)

If you decide you want to try it out, be warned, since a large amount of it is activated by Excel macros in cells in various places, there will be a lot of work to recreate it. If you contact me, I can always send you over a blank version of the Excel spreadsheet instead, with a couple of template pointers where to put everything you need.
